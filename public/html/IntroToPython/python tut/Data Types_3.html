            <p>Welcome to lesson number four, data types! Today, we are going to learn about three data types: Strings, Ints and Floats. Let's get started 😃.</p>

            <h3>Strings:</h3>

            <p>You might not know it, but we've actually already seen an example of a string 😁, <b><span style="color: orange;">"hello world"</span></b>. You might feel a little confused right now 😵‍💫, or maybe you understood everything just fine 😄, but don't worry I'll explain ether way 😉. A string is just a <b>pice of text</b>, like hello world, and for Python to be able to distinguish it from code you need to put double "" or single '' quotes around it, like so: "hello world"</p>

            <h3>Ints:</h3>

            <p>Int is short for integer, and integer just means a <b>whole number</b>. 1 is an integer. You can simply type a whole number and Python will consider it an integer, you don't need any quotes. Please note that if you put a number inside quotes, it <b>will not</b> be read as an integer but as a string, so be careful 😉.</p>

            <h3>Floats:</h3>

            <p>A float is a <b>floating point number</b>, an example of a float is 3.14 because it's a number with one or more decimal places. Floats work the same way as ints, they don't need to be put in quotes and if you do they become strings.</p>

            <p>Thats it for today's lesson! You now know three very important important data types of Python 🎊, see you soon.</p>
